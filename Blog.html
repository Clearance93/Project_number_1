                    <h4>A team of researchers from QuTech in the Netherlands reports realization of the first multi-node quantum network, connecting three quantum processors. In addition, they achieved a proof-of-principle demonstration of key quantum network protocols. Their findings mark an important milestone towards 
                        the future quantum internet and have now been published in Science.

                        The quantum internet
                       
                        The power of the Internet is that it allows any two computers on Earth to be connected with each other, 
                        enabling applications undreamt of at the time of its creation decades ago. Today, researchers in many labs around the world are working towards first versions of 
                        a quantum internet  <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">-- 
                            a network that can connect any two quantum devices, such as quantum computers or sensors, over large distances. Whereas today's Internet 
                         information in bits (that can be either 0 or 1), a future quantum internet will make use of quantum bits that can be 0 and 1 at the same time. 'A quantum internet
                          will open up a range of novel applications, from unhackable communication and cloud computing with complete user privacy to high-precision time-keeping,' says Matteo Pompili,
                           PhD student and a member of the research team. 'And like with the Internet 40 years ago, there are probably many applications we cannot foresee right now.'
                    
                        Towards ubiquitous connectivity

                        The first steps towards a quantum internet were taken in the past decade by linking two quantum devices that shared a direct physical link. However, being able to pass on
                         quantum information through intermediate nodes (analogous to routers in the classical internet) is essential for creating a scalable quantum network. In addition, 
                         many promising quantum internet applications rely on entangled quantum bits, to be distributed between multiple nodes. Entanglement is a phenomenon observed at the quantum scale, 
                         fundamentally connecting particles at small and even at large distances. It provides quantum computers their enormous computational power and it is the fundamental resource for 
                         sharing quantum information over the future quantum internet. By realizing their quantum network in the lab, a team of researchers at QuTech -- a collaboration between Delft University
                         of Technology and TNO -- is the first to have connected two quantum processors through an intermediate node and to have established shared entanglement between multiple stand-alone quantum processors.
                       
                        Operating the quantum network

                        The rudimentary quantum network consists of three quantum nodes, at some distance within the same building. To make these nodes operate as a true network, the researchers had to invent a novel
                         architecture that enables scaling beyond a single link. The middle node (called Bob) has a physical connection to both outer nodes (called Alice and Charlie), allowing entanglement links with 
                         each of these nodes to be established. Bob is equipped with an additional quantum bit that can be used as memory, allowing a previously generated quantum link to be stored while a new link is 
                         being established. After establishing the quantum links Alice-Bob and Bob-Charlie, a set of quantum operations at Bob converts these links into a quantum link Alice-Charlie. Alternatively, 
                         by performing a different set of quantum operations at Bob, entanglement between all three nodes is established.
                    
                        Quantum Internet Demonstrator

                        This first entanglement-based quantum network provides the researchers with a unique testbed for developing and testing quantum internet hardware, software and protocols. 
                        'The future quantum internet will consist of countless quantum devices and intermediate nodes,' says Ronald Hanson, who led the research team. 'Colleagues at QuTech are 
                        already looking into future compatibility with existing data infrastructures.' In due time, the current proof-of-principle approach will be tested outside the lab on 
                        existing telecom fibre -- on QuTech's Quantum Internet Demonstrator, of which the first metropolitan link is scheduled to be completed in 2022.
                   
                        Higher-level layers

                        In the lab, the researchers will focus on adding more quantum bits to their three-node network and on adding higher level software and hardware layers. Pompili:
                         'Once all the high-level control and interface layers for running the network have been developed, anybody will be able to write and run a network application without
                         needing to understand how lasers and cryostats work. That is the end goal.</span>

                    <h3>1. New security threats</h3>
        
                    <p> Headline-grabbing recent events may spark surprising new security threats, says Rick Grinnell, founder and managing partner of Glasswing Ventures.

                        “The government shutdown helped contribute to a great cyber threat to the U.S. government, critical infrastructure and other public and private organizations,” Grinnell says. “With the shutdown, many of the security professionals watching for threats at a national level were not on duty, creating a bigger hole for attackers. Time will tell if a month of lowered defenses will have deeper repercussions in 2019 and beyond.”
                        
                        Tech leaders are also gearing-up for next-generation, AI-driven cyber attacks.
                        
                        “Security professionals must be extra vigilant with detection and training against these threats,” says John Samuel, CIO at CGS. “This year, companies will need to introduce AI-based protection systems to be able to contain any such attacks introduced by this next-gen tech.”
                        
                        Grinnell says AI wasn’t a factor in the most notable attacks of the last year, but he expects that to change.
                        
                        “I believe 2019 will bring the first of many AI-driven attacks on U.S. companies, critical infrastructure and government agencies,” he says. “Let’s hope I’m wrong.”</p>

                <h3>2. Data protection</h3>
    
                    <p>Forward-thinking organizations are now implementing privacy by design in their products, but making sure those efforts meet GDPR standards is an ongoing concern. Google, for example, just saw a record fine by French regulators over how the company collects data.

                        “U.S. businesses will need to consider a GDPR-type policy to protect citizens even before any regulations are enacted,” Samuel says. “Ultimately, there must be international guidelines to ensure customer privacy and protection on a global scale to allow for easier compliance.”
                        
                        Jacob Ansari, senior manager of Schellman and Co., says IoT security got a lot of attention last year, but it led to little practical change in the industry.
                        
                        “The makers of IoT devices still use vulnerable software components, poor network and communication security, and are unable to supply software updates in the field,” says Ansari. “They’re still making essentially all of the mistakes everyone else made in the late 1990s and early
                        2000s. Oh, and your voice-activated home device is spying on you and the company that makes it will give your data to the wrong person by accident with little oversight or accountability. This also suggests that better data privacy legislation — 
                        at least in the U.S. — is a potentially hot topic for 2019, particularly in light of the events of recent elections. Nobody loved implementing GDPR in Europe, but its protections for ordinary people are decent."

                <h2>Vibrations from a smartphone can help us spot unsafe drinking water</h2>
                <p>Vibrations from a smartphone can help us spot unsafe drinking water. The vibrations 
                    from an iPhone's ringtone can be used to measure the viscosity of a liquid, which could allow it to
                     detect whether water is polluted or to test for kidney conditions 
                    and pregnancy by measuring the levels of protein or hormones in urine

                    Clean water free of bacteria is a precious resource in areas where no centralized water facilities are available. Conventional chlorine disinfection is limited by chemical transportation, 
                    storage, and the production of carcinogenic by-products. Here, a smartphone-powered disinfection system is developed for point-of-use (POU) bacterial inactivation. The integrated system uses the smartphone battery as a 
                    power source, and a customized on-the-go (OTG) hardware connected to the phone to realize the desired electrical output. Through a downloadable mobile application, the electrical output, either constant current 
                    (20–1000 µA) or voltage (0.7–2.1 V), can be configured easily through a user-friendly graphical interface on the screen. The disinfection device, a coaxial-electrode copper ionization cell (CECIC), inactivates bacteria by 
                    low levels of electrochemically generated copper with low energy consumption. The strategy of constant current control is applied in this study to solve the problem of uncontrollable copper release by previous constant voltage control.
                     With the current control, a high inactivation efficiency of E. coli (~6 logs) is achieved with a low level of effluent Cu (~200 µg L−1) in the water samples within a range of salt concentration (0.2–1 mmol L−1). The smartphone-based power 
                     workstation provides a versatile and accurate electrical output with a simple graphical user interface. The disinfection device is robust, highly efficient, and does not require complex equipment. As smartphones are pervasive in modern life, 
                     the smartphone-powered CECIC system could provide an alternative
                     decentralized water disinfection approach like rural areas and outdoor activities.

                    Clean water free of bacteria is precious for public health. The water treatment and supply in the United States (U.S.) are mostly conducted by centralized
                     drinking water plants. Still, 14% of the total population access drinking water from self-supplied sources (e.g., wells), according to a 2017 report from U.S.
                      Geological Survey1,2. Without proper water treatment, about 700,000 residents in California’s Central Valley are currently being exposed to contaminated water at home or school. 
                      Even worse, American Community Survey data suggest that 1.6 million individuals in the U.S. lack the basic indoor plumbing1. Looking at the big picture, 
                      it is not economical to build treatment plants in rural areas because of their high capital and maintenance costs. Thus, the threat of unsafe drinking water becomes 
                      a pressing problem, especially from waterborne pathogens. Drinking undisinfected water may cause diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, or even death. According to the US Centers 
                      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report in 2017, waterborne diseases cause about 7,000 death, 477,000 emergency department visits, and $3.8 billion for disease-associated treatment3.
                       Therefore, access to clean water free of bacteria is the essential and basic need for public health.

                    The water treatment process to remove/inactivate bacteria is called disinfection4. The conventional disinfection in centralized facilities
                     and distribution systems is usually not applicable to decentralized areas5. Consequently, it is critical to developing point-of-use (POU)
                      disinfection methods. Chlorination kits are efficient, handy, and low-cost. However, the proper storage and transportation of chemicals are challenging in rural areas6,7. 
                      Rechargeable ultraviolet lamps have been developed and commercialized, but is confined by the high energy consumption and limited treatment volume per charge8,9,10. 
                      On-site ozone generators rely on standard voltage inputs (110 or 220 V), which are also hardly accessible after calamity or in underdeveloped areas11. 
                      POU disinfection techniques assisted by new materials arise quickly, including photocatalytic process12,13,14, locally enhanced electric field treatment (LEEFT)15,16, 
                      and filtration17,18,19,20,21. These techniques conquer some limitations of the previous methods (e.g., complex equipment, the formation of by-products, and/or demand of chemicals),
                       but also suffer from different drawbacks, including long treatment time, short product lifespan, and/or fouling problems.

                    In such context, we are eagerly looking for an efficient disinfection method that is simple, robust, and energy-efficient. In recent years,
                     electrochemical disinfection has become a more feasible approach because of its versatile reactions, high inactivation efficiency, and low cost22.
                      Tremendous electrogenerated antimicrobial species have been developed and approved efficient, such as active chlorine (e.g., Cl2 and HClO),
                       reactive oxygen species (e.g., •OH and •O2-), and metal ions (e.g., Ag+ and Cu2+)22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32. A recently developed coaxial-electrode 
                       copper ionization cell (CECIC) achieved 6-log inactivation of E. coli with a low level of Cu concentration (~200 µg L−1), low applied voltage (1.5 V), 
                       and low estimated cost (~$ 0.1 m−3)33,34. Notably, the effluent Cu concentration for efficient disinfection is far lower than the maximum contaminant 
                       level goal (MCLG) of 1300 µg L−1 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The CECIC utilized both electrochemically generated Cu ions and the non-uniform
                        electric field brought by the coaxial-electrode design to provide a new method for POU water disinfection.

                    In rural areas, the power grid is much more accessible for household35. However, electrochemical disinfection usually requires adjustable 
                    and accurate electrical output, and thus expensive and complex equipment (e.g., electrochemical workstations)36. Smartphones are potentially
                    an excellent alternative of power sources because of their pervasive existence in the modern life37. Smartphones can provide a user-friendly 
                    graphical interface, high-class energy storage and output (the lithium ion battery), and a highly programable platform. Smartphone-dependent 
                    applications have been developed for water monitoring and sensing38,39,40. The rapid detection of bacterial density, heavy metal, and salinity
                     using smartphones has been reported with the advantages of compact size, low cost, and user friendly. However, to the best of our knowledge, 
                     smartphones have never been used as a mobile power bank to conduct water disinfection.

                    Herein, we report an integrated smartphone-powered CECIC disinfection system with high pathogen inactivation efficiency and 
                    capacity (Fig. 1). The electrical output from the smartphone is realized by using a rationally designed Universal Serial Bus
                     (USB) on-the-go (OTG) module and a downloadable mobile app. Through the mobile app, a constant current or voltage can be 
                     configured and delivered via the OTG module with high accuracy, even when the battery is running low (>5%). Powered by
                      the proposed system, the CECIC device achieves >6-log bacterial inactivation with a constant current operation. Unlike the 
                      previous voltage control, the constant current provides a controllable rate of copper ion release to diverse water matrixes 
                      within the range that poses little toxicity to humans. Such an integrated disinfection system along with its high performance 
                      in different water matrixes 
                    demonstrates its feasibility to be applied in real-world cases to provide bacteria-free drinking water.
